# VillagerUnknown's Cursed Coins for Villager Coin

_This is an addon mod for Villager Coin._

Adds a variety of cursed Copper, Iron, Gold, Emerald, and Netherite coins to Villager Coin that apply harmful status effects when in a player's inventory. 

Cursed coins, like collectable coins, can be traded with other players in your world, put on display in your base, or converted to the common Villager Coins of equal value through the crafting table for trading with Villagers.

Cursed coins are valuable coins, rarer than common Villager Coins, with limited quantities in circulation that apply a status effect when in a player's inventory. 

Cursed coins have a maximum amount that can exist in the world. 
When a coin is destroyed, and removed from the world, the maximum amount can be reached again allowing another coin to generate in the world.

_This mod includes a coin that can kill you when in your inventory, the Cursed Netherite Death Coin. It can be identified by it's skull and crossbones design. To get the value of this coin you will have to find a way to transport it and get it in an auto-crafter without dying._
